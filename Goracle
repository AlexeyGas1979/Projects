sudo wget -qP /usr/bin/ https://staging.dev.goracle.io/downloads/latest-staging/goracle && sudo chmod u+x /usr/bin/goracle
sudo goracle init

1.1
Continue? [y/N]?
Use Algonode Algorand API service (recommended)? [Y/n]?
answer Y both 1st and 2nd time

1.2 
Enter Algonode API auth token or press enter for free-tier default
Press Enter

1.3
Enter your main Algorand account address
1. Go to https://testnet-app.goracle.io/nodes/optin, connect with your wallet and copy the address (highlighted on screenshot)
2. And paste it in terminal
3. Then press Enter.

1.4 Register your participation address
1. Open the participation address registration link in your browser.
2. The page should look like this (you may need to connect your Pera wallet again)

3. Press Register (green button).
4. Confirm transactions in your wallet (for Pera you should check your mobile app)
If you get the following error after you have confirmed the transactions, please check that you've enabled pop-ups and you have Algos in your wallet (faucet).

Then you will need to top up (use the faucet) for your participation address

The next step is only for those who have received their access codes. If you haven't, just skip it, you'll still be able to install the node and relay the feeds, but won't participate in the consensus. You will also still complete "Run A Node" task.
1.5 Stake tokens (requires access code)
1. Press "Get Test Gora"
2. Paste your code
3. Add stake
Then confirm your actions in the wallet and you will see that your stake has increased

1.6 Return to the terminal and press Enter.
2. Install docker
bash <(wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ttimmatti/dependencies/main/docker.sh)
You should see similar output (there can be a lot more output lines, it's ok):

3. Run the node
sudo goracle docker-start --background

4. Check the logs
docker logs -f goracle-nr
Press Ctrl+c to exit logs

Update
goracle update

You should change your Algorand Node Api endpoint. For that:
1. Register at PureStake https://developer.purestake.io/home
2. Get your PureStake Api Key
3. In your terminal run
nano ~/.goracle

Where the highlighted key is YOUR ACTUAL PURESTAKE API KEY.
So, you should delete the first two lines from the initial file and add these three instead:
    "authKey": "YOUR_KEY",
    "server": "https://testnet-algorand.api.purestake.io/ps2",
    "authHeader": "x-api-key",
When you're done press Ctrl+x, then Y, then Enter.
After that run 
goracle docker-stop && goracle docker-start --background
And check the logs with logs command
