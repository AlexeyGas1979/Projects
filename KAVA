We participated in the mainnet, first we had delegated tokens by the DVS team. 
Then they suddenly split up, they say we are not doing anything for the project. 
And there is absolutely nothing to do - in the discord there are only memes and giggles, all the main rewards and buns were eaten by the early adherents of the project. 
Gained experience. We delete the node. We close the project.
